# eye-controlled-mouse
Welcome to our journey into a fantastic new invention: the eye-controlled mouse. This amazing technology is making a huge difference for people with disabilities. It helps them be more independent and use computers like never before. Let's explore how this special mouse works and how it's helping lots of people.

# WORKING
Eye-controlled mouse works by using a camera or sensor to track the movement of a person's eyes. When the person looks at a specific point on the screen, the camera detects this and moves the cursor there. This means that instead of using a traditional mouse or keyboard, people can control their computer just by looking at it. It's like magic â€“ but really, it's clever technology that's helping people who have difficulty using their hands to interact with computers in a whole new way.
